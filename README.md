Chempe単o: Vehicle Pawn Platform (developing)
Description
Chempe単o is an innovative online platform that facilitates the pawning of used vehicles, allowing owners to quickly obtain cash loans by using their cars as collateral. Through Chempe単o, investors can participate in auctions to determine the interest rate of the loan, providing a unique and secure investment alternative.

How Does It Work?
Vehicle Appraisal: Each vehicle is professionally appraised to determine its market value. This value sets the maximum loan amount.

Loan Request: Vehicle owners can request loans, offering their car as collateral.

Repayment: The owner repays the loan in monthly installments with the agreed-upon interest.

In case of Default: If the loan is not repaid as agreed, the vehicle is transferred to Grupo Fiancar, which takes charge of selling the car to recover the loan, the profit from interest, and an additional compensation for the delay.
